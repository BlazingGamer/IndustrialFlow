Minecraft 1.7.10 Mod that will become global
This is mod for MC 1.7.10, it will become global! Right now it adds:
- Flint ore that generates on ground and flint tools
- Cobalt & Nickel ores and tools created using their ingots
- Topaz ore and tools
- Gallium and Germanium ores, they drop dusts. At the moment they aren't usable (but stock on em)
- Copper and tools created using it
- Tin, you can create bronze and hammers with it. Bronze is slightly worse than iron
- Cadmium - create C.Plates using hammers and C.Rods using workbench and plates
- Tungsten - used for Tungstate, material that is better than diamonds, and for T.Plates for creating ultimate weapons
- Titanium - one of the best mod materials
- Palladium and Ruthenium ores - smelt into nuggets, combine 9 nuggets to get an ingot
- Ultimate tools - much like OreSpawn tools. Create with Palladium ingots, Ruthenium ingots and Cadmium rods
- Ultimate sword - 40 damage + enchantments. Create with Palladium, Ruthenium, Tungsten plates and Cadmium rods
- I'll add lots of other things...
